# Mercado Libre Mobile Candidate

Project to attend at MELI mobile candidate process.

## Description
The app is developed using MVVM architecture and the SwiftUI framework to create the app screens, to connect at meli endpoints is used Alamofire framework and to store some user data is used native UserDefaults.
Feedbacks for the user are giving by 'text labels' (such as: loading, error, etc.)

## System Requirements
* XCode: 14.3.1;
* Swift: 5;
* MacOS: Ventura 13.4.1;
* Ruby: 2.6.10p210 (2022-04-12 revision 67958);
* CocoaPods: 1.12.1.

## Frameworks Versions
* Alamofire: '5.7.1';
* Mocker: '2.5.5'.

## What to do next ?
- App needs a more beautiful user feedback layout;
- The first category that app shows is fixed in the code;
- Need to find a better image for 'Details' screen. Today is the same 'thumbnail' used in 'Products', so in the 'Detail' the image is not to good.
